# Recommendations for bringing visual elements to your team structure

## Communicating story and task progress
### How to help my team needs with this?
| What does it look like? | What could visual thinking have to do with it? | What can I do to make it better? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Team is missing deadlines or dependencies unexpectedly, with no issues being communicated | Visual thinkers hold crystal-clear images of the work they need to do in their brain. It can be hard to communicate the complexity of that image in a brief update | (Visual tools for documenting story progress like discovery trees)[https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/discovery-trees/] |
| Pulling too much work into sprint | Time/effort are not a visual concept, so it can be difficult to understand what will fit | Use a visual-spatial representation of time with your digital whiteboard |
| Team is unaware of what others are doing or what is done in the scope of work | Thinking visually requires overhead to convert models in our heads to words. This can lead to imprecise language, or inaccurate interpretations of task progress | Moving items across a kanban board or checking them off in a task list or changing their color in a discovery tree is unambiguous |
| Team hears and sees what is being done in the sprint, but doesn't connect the tasks back to the actual code | People thinking visually need to understand the larger picture in order to understand the details. | Involve the team in scoping and understanding the requirements of the work, as well as breaking down and writing stories AND/OR Pair or ensemble on work |
