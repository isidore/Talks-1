# Recommendations for bringing visual elements to your team structure

## Communicating story and task progress
### How to help my team needs with this?
| What does it look like? | What could visual thinking have to do with it? | What can I do to make it better? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Team is missing deadlines or dependencies unexpectedly, with no issues being communicated | Visual thinkers hold crystal-clear images of the work they need to do in their brain. It can be hard to communicate the complexity of that image in a brief update | [Visual tools for documenting story progress like discovery trees](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/discovery-trees/). Pair or Ensemble on writing code so the context of story progress is shared |
| Pulling too much work into sprint | Time/effort are not a visual concept, so it can be difficult to understand what will fit | Use a visual-spatial representation of available time or effort to  |
| Team is unaware of what others are doing or what is done in the scope of work | Thinking visually requires overhead to convert models in our heads to words. This can lead to imprecise language, or inaccurate interpretations of task progress | Move items across a kanban board or check them off in a task list or some other unambiguous indication of progress. Pair or Ensemble on writing code so the context of story progress is shared |
| Team hears and sees what is being done in the sprint, but doesn't connect the tasks back to the actual code | People thinking visually need to understand the larger picture in order to understand the details. | Involve the team in scoping and understanding the requirements of the work, as well as breaking down and writing stories AND/OR Pair or ensemble on work |

## Make sure everyone is heard in meetings
| What does it look like? | What could visual thinking have to do with it? | What can I do to make it better? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| One or two members dominate all conversations and steer discussions | Thinking visually requires us to take time to convert our solutions, pictures and ideas into words. By the time we've done that, the discussion has moved on. | Use a visual method, like sticky notes, or a digital whiteboard to allow people to write down their ideas before the discussion starts. [Lean coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) is a helpful and simple format to follow |
| Hard to get a meeting summary or agenda beforehand | Thinking visually and associatively makes it very hard to document a linear, logical ordered agenda | If agendas are required, create a template where developers can answer a few simple questions to provide the minimum number of details needed. |
| Many One-on-one meetings in order to scope and understand a project | Visual thinking can mean identifying the people needed _as they are needed_. Sometimes the inputs needed are not obvious until the work is being scoped. | Spend time ahead of the project to collect a list of required inputs. Schedule a recurring meeting (like a demo) with all of them ahead of time so that you can get input and feedback |

## Sharing knowledge about systems between team members
| What does it look like? | What could visual thinking have to do with it? | What can I do to make it better? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Team disagrees on system structure and flow of data, or in general the whole system is not understood | In order to understand something visually, we need to encounter the idea in multiple different contexts and presentation formats | If documentation is only recorded in large written summaries, collaborate as a group on drawing the system. If documentation doesn't exist, or only exists in drawings, pair two developers to write it. Understanding the system in a different mode |
| Team has deeply siloed ownership and does not want to collaborate or share access to "their" code | Once a visual model of a system is learned, retention is permanent, and it's almost effortless for the visualizer to understand and create new concepts around the system. Sharing code makes the system change without the awareness of the visualizer. | Pair or ensemble on writing code. Include the principal owner in pull requests for new changes, and/or have a rotating support role so that all team members are required to support eachothers' systems |
| Team is constantly asking the same, simple questions about systems, and getting frustrated with answering them | Visual-spatial learners understand concepts best when focusing on the relationships between things rather than memorization | Teach systems by interacting with them. Provide a note-taking platform that allows recording of things that need to be memorized before relationships are understood. Ideally these should not be a public wiki so that each developer can organize them according to their own internal systems (ie. [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/)). |
