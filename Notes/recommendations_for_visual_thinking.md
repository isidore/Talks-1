# Recommendations for bringing visual elements to your team structure

## Communicating story and task progress
### How to help my team needs with this?

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Team is missing deadlines or dependencies unexpectedly, with no issues being communicated | Visual thinkers hold crystal-clear images of the work they need to do in their brain. It can be hard to communicate the complexity of that image in a brief update | [Visual tools for documenting story progress like discovery trees](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/discovery-trees/) |
| Pulling too much work into sprint | Time/effort are not a visual concept, so it can be difficult to understand what will fit | Use a visual-spatial representation of time with your digital whiteboard |
| Team is unaware of what others are doing or what is done in the scope of work | Thinking visually requires overhead to convert models in our heads to words. This can lead to imprecise language, or inaccurate interpretations of task progress | Moving items across a kanban board or checking them off in a task list or changing their color in a discovery tree is unambiguous |
| Team hears and sees what is being done in the sprint, but doesn't connect the tasks back to the actual code | People thinking visually need to understand the larger picture in order to understand the details. | Involve the team in scoping and understanding the requirements of the work, as well as breaking down and writing stories AND/OR Pair or ensemble on work |

## Make sure everyone is heard in meetings
| What does it look like? | What could visual thinking have to do with it? | What can I do to make it better? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| One or two members dominate all conversations and steer discussions | Thinking visually requires us to take time to convert our solutions, pictures and ideas into words. By the time we've done that, the discussion has moved on. | Use a visual method, like sticky notes, or a digital whiteboard to allow people to write down their ideas before the discussion starts. [Lean coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) is a helpful and simple format to follow |
| Hard to get a meeting summary or agenda beforehand | Thinking visually and associatively makes it very hard to document a linear, logical ordered agenda | If agendas are required, create a template where developers can answer a few simple questions to provide the minimum number of details needed. |
| Many One-on-one meetings in order to scope and understand a project | Visual thinking can mean identifying the people needed _as they are needed_. Sometimes the inputs needed are not obvious until the work is being scoped. | Spend time ahead of the project to collect a list of required inputs. Schedule a recurring meeting (like a demo) with all of them ahead of time so that you can get input and feedback |
