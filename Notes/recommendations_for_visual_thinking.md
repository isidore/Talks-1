# Recommendations for bringing visual elements to your team structure

## Communicating story and task progress
### How to help my team needs help with this?
| What does it look like? | What could visual thinking have to do with it? | What can I do to make it better? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Team is missing deadlines or dependencies unexpectedly, with no issues being communicated | Visual thinkers hold crystal-clear images of the work they need to do in their brain. It can be hard to communicate the complexity of that image in a brief update | (Visual tools for documenting story progress like discovery trees)[https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/discovery-trees/] |
| Pulling too much work into sprint | Time/effort are not a visual concept, so it can be difficult to understand what will fit | Use a visual-spatial representation of time with your digital whiteboard |
### What can I do?
When we think visually, we keep track of many different things that need to be done all at once in our brains. We see and understand the relationships between all the pieces, and every piece relies on every other one. Jira tickets aren't part of our visualization.
